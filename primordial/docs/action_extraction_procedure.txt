The following procedure was used to figure out and extract all available gameworld and lobby
actions

    1. Parse game.js for Travian.request() and Travian.writeRequest() function calls. Each call
    will contain the first parameter in the form of "controller/action". Regex those out, remove
    duplicates and stack into a dict in the form of
    {'controller': {'action1': {}, 'action2': {}}}
    3. Using a browser of your choice invoke as many or as few actions in the gameworld and save
    the network logs as a .HAR file
    4. Run action_extractor.py, which will take the .HAR file and produce a result<timestamp>.json
    file with all the new (compared to gameworld_actions.py) controllers and actions that it found
